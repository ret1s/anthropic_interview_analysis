Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. \n\nWe're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.\n\nDuring our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.\n\nI'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. \n\nDoes that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\nUser: No, I don't have any questions. Let's do it!\n\nAI: Great! Let's dive in.\n\nCould you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: I pretty rarely use AI in my typical workday. I tend to only use it when I need help coming up with new sales strategies or different ways to improve interactions with customers.\n\nAI: Tell me more about those situations where you do turn to AI for sales strategies or customer interactions. What does that process look like for you?\n\nUser: I will open the AI model and provide it with a scenario that I may run into at work and ask it to come up with a unique strategy to increase my chances of making a sale.\n\nAI: What happens after the AI gives you those strategies? Do you typically use them as-is, or do you find yourself modifying them based on your own experience?\n\nUser: I always modify them. They're never \"perfect\". Sometimes they're repetitive or not relevant for my work. However, I still use the overall strategy.\n\nAI: That's really interesting - you're essentially using AI as a starting point and then applying your own judgment. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?\n\nUser: I do not believe there are any tasks that AI could help with that I prefer to do myself in my line of work.\n\nAI: That's fascinating - so it sounds like when AI can help, you're open to using it. But you mentioned you only use it rarely in your typical workday. What determines when you actually turn to AI versus handling things on your own?\n\nUser: I turn to AI when I'm stuck. For example, if there's a new product I'm selling and I don't know how to pitch it to someone, I will turn to AI for help.\n\nAI: So AI becomes your go-to when you hit a roadblock. When you use AI for help with something like pitching a new product, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout figuring out the pitch, or do you tend to give it all the context upfront and let it handle the task independently?\n\nUser: I tend to give it all the context up front. I do not typically go back and forth with the AI.\n\nAI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?\n\nUser: My colleagues have influenced the way I use AI because I tend to use it more often when I need to \"compete\" with them. If my sales for the month are low compared to them, I tend to turn to AI for help.\n\nAI: That's a really interesting dynamic - using AI as a competitive edge when you need to catch up. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: One time I used AI to develop a strategy for selling a product I wasn't familiar with and it worked extremely well. I was very satisfied because I made the most sales that month out of my whole team.\n\nAI: That sounds like a great success! What made that AI-generated strategy work so well compared to other times you've used it? Was there something different about how you approached it or the situation itself?\n\nUser: I gave a lot of details in this specific scenario. I provided as much details as possible and I noticed it really made a difference. I also included information about myself and my personality to help the AI cater the strategy to myself as a person.\n\nAI: That's a valuable insight about the importance of detailed context and personal information. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: I've thought about it a bit but I prefer to work with AI and use it to better myself instead of competing.\n\nAI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?\n\nUser: I think I will continue to use it the way I have. I hope in the future, the AI will improve and thus improve my performance at work as well.\n\nAI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a competitive tool when you need to catch up with colleagues, and how providing detailed personal context made such a difference in the strategy's effectiveness.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: No, that is all.\n\nAI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a problem-solving tool when you're stuck, the importance of detailed context, and how workplace competition influences your AI usage will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!",

What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: I use AI sparingly at my job. I only use it to make sure that my grammar and spelling are correct on the emails I send to clients.\n\nAI: Tell me more about that. What made you decide to use AI specifically for grammar and spelling in client emails rather than other tools or methods?\n\nUser: I use Grammarly primarily. I'd been asked to use it for a task at a part time job at one point and, after trying it out, I found it superior to my computer's normal spell/grammar check. Grammarly catches a lot more issues than my computer does, though I don't always use its suggestions.\n\nAI: That's interesting - you mentioned you don't always use Grammarly's suggestions. Can you walk me through what that decision-making process looks like when you're reviewing its recommendations?\n\nUser: Sure. I almost always use its spelling suggestions, but sometimes it gives me tips on sentence flow or how to make my sentences sound more friendly or more formal that don't really sound like the way I'd talk or write, so I ignore them. I want to make sure I don't have grammar errors when writing to my clients, but I also want to preserve my voice as I am the sole owner and operator at my business.\n\nAI: That makes a lot of sense - wanting to maintain your authentic voice while ensuring professional quality. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?\n\nUser: For the most part, I'd prefer to handle anything besides grammar on my own. I'm a home inspector, so there isn't a lot of my business that can be handled by AI. The only other tasks I can think of would be something like scheduling tasks, but that doesn't take up much of my time so I don't feel the need to delegate it. It's possible that AI could help me write my reports, but I need to use very specific language and I already have templates for that.\n\nAI: That's helpful context about your work as a home inspector. When you mention that AI could potentially help with reports but you need \"very specific language\" - can you tell me more about what makes that language so specific and why your existing templates work better for you?\n\nUser: Sure. It's important that my clients can understand what I'm talking about, but also that I state things in a way that keeps me as safe from litigation as possible. The templates I use are based on what I learned in my inspection classes and also, every state has different requirements for what needs to be reported and how.\n\nAI: That's really insightful - the legal and regulatory considerations make a big difference. When you use Grammarly for your client emails, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach AI tools? Or since you're a sole proprietor, how do interactions with clients or other professionals in your field shape your thinking about using AI?\n\nUser: At this point, I don't think the home inspection industry is using AI very much, at least I haven't heard about it. I did want to point out that I do actually work with a company that uses AI for mold and air quality testing, which seems to be working well for them.\n\nAI: That's an interesting distinction - seeing AI work well for the mold and air quality testing company while your own industry hasn't adopted it much yet. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: With mold and air quality, there are very specific particulates that they're looking for, so I can understand why that would work for them. It also takes place in a lab while my industry is completely in the field so there are a lot of different factors. During work, I don't think I've had an experience that made me feel particularly satisfied or frustrated, except for when Grammarly abruptly stops working.\n\nAI: Tell me more about when Grammarly stops working. What happens in those moments and how does that affect your workflow?\n\nUser: Usually it just stops working in one application, like when I'm writing an email. Either I just send the email as is, or I transfer it to something else, like a Google Doc, use Grammarly there, and then copy it back into the email, which slows things down a little.\n\nAI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: It's something I consider, but not something I really worry about in my field. Even if AI could find defects within a home, someone would still need to know what they were looking at enough to even consider it to be a problem and know to ask about it.\n\nAI: That's a practical perspective - the human expertise and judgment remaining essential. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?\n\nUser: In the short term, I doubt it will change from what it is now. It's possible that at some point I'll be able to use AI to double check issues I'm concerned about. Like the slope of a furnace exhaust pipe or whether a crack looks concerning or not.\n\nAI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the field-based nature of home inspection creates different considerations than lab-based work, and your focus on maintaining both professional quality and your authentic voice.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: no\n\nAI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to hear about how different industries have varying levels of AI adoption and the specific considerations that drive those decisions.\n\nHave a great rest of your day!",

Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\nUser: No questions, we can begin\n\nAI: Great! Let's dive in then.\n\nCould you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: I've used it primarily in the creation of spreadsheets. For example, there have been times when I need to track certain information relating to hiring or other data sets I need to share with the employees and I need a spreadsheet to contain certain formulas. I might not always be up on the necessary formulas to get the spreadsheet to organize my data the way I want, or I may have forgotten, if I haven't created that type of spreadsheet in a while or have been using my old templates for a long time, so in tools such as Google sheets for example, I will try and collaborate with the AI there to help design what I need in order to save me time trying to figure out how to create the spreadsheet I need.\n\nAI: That's a really practical use case. When you say you \"collaborate with the AI\" in Google Sheets to design what you need - can you walk me through what that interaction typically looks like?\n\nUser: So using my specific use case example, I would open a new spreadsheet in Google sheets and ask Gemini to create a spreadsheet that does what I need it to do, for example, dynamically alphabetize all rows by column B.\n\nAI: Tell me more about how that process unfolds from there. Once you make that initial request to Gemini, what happens next in your workflow?\n\nUser: From my past experience, it usually takes a couple times before I feel like Gemini understands what I want, even if its something that I feel is simple, and once I feel it does, it will usually offer me some options to select. However, for the most part I haven't found many of them to be correct. Usually the tables suggested don't exactly do what I need or are missing key integration elements that prevent me from readily using the spreadsheet as I imagined without having to take the time to educate or reeducate myself externally anyway. in other words, I never find it as intuitive or as 'point and click' as I am expecting. For tasks that are done more sporadically like maybe once every couple months, just being able to say \"I want a spreadsheet that does this...\" and have it be done would shorten my time between creative imagination and reality and make my workflow so much smoother. I guess, till now, the AI integration never seems to be the labor saving device that I am envisioning, it seems far too complex on the front end if htat makes sense.\n\nAI: That makes a lot of sense - there's this gap between what you're hoping for and what you're actually getting. When you mention it being \"far too complex on the front end,\" it sounds like you're spending more time trying to communicate what you want than you'd spend just figuring it out yourself.\n\nGiven those experiences, how do you decide whether to try using AI for a spreadsheet task or just tackle it on your own?\n\nUser: well the deciding factor for me is, if Im spending three tries trying to get the AI to deliver what I want and then having to worry about my specific prompting, even when I am very explicit and direct, to achieve its desired output, then I could do a quick web search and likely find people asking a similar question to what I need or a video and read through several webpages and forum threads in that same time to just teach myself how to do it. Like, if it takes me ten minutes to get the AI to do what I need, I can just learn it in 10 minutes and then create a step by step instruction sheet for myself if this is a non regular recurring task. And I can do this for everything, its just ideally faster if I could theoretically use an AI to get me there and saves the necessity of me saving and organizing tons of instruction sets for myself for all these type of tasks. I think of it like GPS. before GPS I used to have to plot my route beforehand, and make sure I had maps with me, organize and store those maps and pull over during my drive so I could consult the map, alwasy keep an eye oand thought tuned towards the map and be conscious of my landmarks and surroundings. Once I got GPS in my car and phone, I could route to a destination instantly and gain an approximation of destination and travel time whenever I needed it, like during planning a trip, and once I got in the car, I simplyu entered a simple destination and I was brought to my destination with multiple accessible routes everytime. Seemlessly, repetitively, flawlessly. This alleviated the entire burden of navigation for me and all the tools and resources that went along with that and make navigation instantaneous and contained in a small portable device. This meaningfully saved quantifiable time and have a measureable improvement in my effectiveness by allowing me to do what I do best, executive and creative decision making, while the GPS did what it does best handle quantification and remembering lots of data. Together we exponentially improved our effectiveness. I have not felt that same benefit with AI use in the workplace. It feels like AI wants to interact too much on my level of world interaction and is not refined enough to handle its tasks, the things I either cant do or dont want to do. To put it plainly, I dont need ideas as much as I need something to execute the ideas I have so I can iterate  those ideas faster .\n\nAI: That GPS comparison is really illuminating - you're looking for that same kind of seamless, reliable execution where you input what you want and it just works, letting you focus on the higher-level thinking.\n\nIt sounds like right now, AI feels more like having to negotiate with a partner who doesn't quite understand the assignment, rather than having a tool that just executes your vision. When you say \"I don't need ideas as much as I need something to execute the ideas I have\" - that really captures something important about what you're looking for from AI at work.\n\nHave you found any tasks or situations where AI has come closer to that GPS-like experience for you?\n\nUser: Unfortunately, I haven't found any tasks or situations where AI has come closer to that GPS like experience for me\n\nAI: That's a pretty clear picture then. Given that experience, how do your colleagues or your workplace culture influence the way you approach AI tools? Do you see others having similar experiences, or are people around you using AI differently?\n\nUser: I'm not sure to be honest. I tend to have a fair amount of autonomy in my department so I don't know how similar positions in other departments are making use of AI tools, but I have not heard much specific conversation about it. I find that I tend to be more forward thinking in the realm of integrating technology to improve work related outcomes, however. For example, I make wide use of macros and simple automation to simplify tasks and Im not aware that any of my peers do.\n\nAI: That's interesting - you're already someone who actively looks for ways to use technology to streamline work, with things like macros and automation, but AI hasn't delivered that same kind of practical benefit yet.\n\nCan you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: I think the spreadsheet example I gave earlier stood out to me because that was particularly frustrating. If Im doing a lot of spreadsheet work, I tend to just educate myself for the specific task at hand, but then in my daily work I will default to using templates I've saved or prexsisting shared documents. So after a large hiring push I had a large number of new employees and supervisors and noticed that the supervisors were missing critical data that they needed to make sure the employees were saying the correct information. I needed to create a shared spreadsheet that I could dynamically update multiple times a day that also needed to oragnize the data in a certain way every time I added new information. This is a simple task for someone who is more of a daily spreadsheet power user, but It had been months for me  and I had forgotten how to structure a spreadsheet to do that. So specifically in that instance I needed somehting to work the way I needed it to and quickly so i could address an issue I was noticing in real time. This is a perfect example where AI could have been so beneficial and allowed me to get what I needed instantly at the moment I saw a need. I specifically turned to AI becasue I was worried it might take me too long to educate myself and I needed to solve this problem now. However, it took several prompts and still it never organized the data the way I needed it too. SO I ended up just disseminating the spreadsheet unorganized and then taking some time later in the day to reducate myself on the appropriate formulas and fixing the spreadsheet myself.\n\nAI: That's such a perfect example of where AI could have been transformative but fell short exactly when you needed it most. You had a real-time problem that needed solving, and instead of being your GPS equivalent, AI became another obstacle between you and the solution.\n\nIt sounds like you ended up having to send out the unorganized version and then circle back to fix it properly later - so the immediate need your supervisors had wasn't fully met in that moment.\n\nHow do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: Yes I do consider that. And thats a very important thing. I think we have reached a level of complexity in technology that It may be long past that point. What I mean by that is, I belive there are essential skills relevant to biological organisms that are essential to maintain. Unfortunatley, we have let many of these skills lapse. In terms of computer technology skills not essential to biological survival, there are already a small handful of people who can understand those skills and practice them and that number is shrinking all the time as our computer technology gets more sophisticated. I think the only way out is through so to speak. For example, there is alwasy concern over Google's curation of data in its search results with its heavy algorithmic governance however, the flip side to that is there is so much data out there, it becomes an impossiblity to find the meaningful thing you want or need without some sort of management and specific targeting of that data. Its a nice thought to search for things in the 'old way' but when you have billions of hits, your ability to sort through that data becomes an impossibility and so like it or not, the two first pages of Google become necessary. It is the same with tech. We are already at the point where the skillset available to the masses is the operation of said tech but the development without specialized knowledge is much more rare and the barrier to entry gets higher provided we are talking abotu a broadcast approach. Once we get to the integration of hardware and software, the skill pool becomes smaller and once we get to the development of new hardware and specific hardware elements, the skill pool is extremely small. So bearing all that in mind, as long as we heavily use and rely on computer technology and want to increase and get more complex in what computer technology can do, it makes sense to hand off those 'skills' to a machine that can manage such a vast repository of data and allow us to integrate with said machines in a complimentary way rather than a competitive way. So, no I'm not as worried about maintaining my skills in an obsolete area if a machine can get me to the place I need to be faster than me manually doing it, however, I am worried about use creating enough redundancy and accessibility so that fi we hand off these 'skills' to a machine that it serves to be accessible all the time and reasonably for as long as we  exist and that it serves to increase quality of life for the majority of people rather than decrease it. That is a very existential answer to what may have been intended as a more surface level question. So I will address it from a more surface level now: In terms of what that means for me wiht the thought of \"Will AI take my job?\", Yes I think automation and specifically AI does threaten many jobs, and I think a lot of the workforce wont necessarily have the skills to compete in decades to come, but I guess that I'm hoping, perhaps naively so, that it may lessen human labor and increase productivity and hopefully we can all benefit from that. At least the potential may be for individuals to benefit by greater independence. but I am not sure how it will all play out. In terms of maintaining the ability to navigate without the GPS, to use an analogy, I think its important to maintain the underlying principles, but as mentioned, there is a threshold of complexity that we can reach where the skillsets necessary to maintain along the way are too great to reasonably do, so redundancy and accessibility are critical at that point, not maintaining skills if there are too many levels to work back to the beginning should we/I need to start over if that makes sense.\n\nAI: That's a remarkably thoughtful perspective - you're thinking about this on multiple levels, from the practical \"will this make my work better\" to these deeper questions about technological dependence and societal impact. Your point about redundancy and accessibility being more critical than maintaining obsolete skills once we cross certain complexity thresholds really stands out.\n\nLooking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given where you are now and what you've described about wanting that GPS-like reliability, what would need to change for you to find AI more useful?\n\nUser: I think AI has great potential within the workplace specifically for smaller or independent businesses where it could serve as a means to accomplish tasks where workers or owners may lack skillset. I believe that will have to be the point at which businesses find it essential to integrate. I think, personally, that AI becoming more specific and specialized in its execution might be an important element and then tying it all together with a more conversational interface that serves as an translator of sorts from our common parlance to what the specific machine needs to execute. In other words, it feels like with workplace integration theres possibly too much discussion going on with the AI as opposed to the conversational AI serving as a mediator to take my needs and translate them to an AI that can execute them in a specialized way. Thats the first thing that comes to mind. However, bear in mind I am limited by my experience and I have learned that we can often find other ways of doing things we have never thought of before that may indeed be better. I do think that the point of integration mroe like a tool that responds to plain speech rather than a companion might be the starting point of greater integration.\n\nAI: That vision of AI as more of a translator or intermediary - where you'd speak naturally to one interface that then coordinates with specialized execution engines behind the scenes - that's a compelling way to think about it. Rather than trying to negotiate directly with the AI that's supposed to do the work, you'd have that conversational layer that truly understands what you need and can orchestrate the right specialized tools to deliver it seamlessly.\n\nThose are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your GPS analogy and your perspective on how AI could evolve to be more like a specialized tool with a conversational interface rather than trying to be a collaborative partner.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: No, those are all my primary thoughts in terms of my experience in the workplace use of AI at this moment\n\nAI: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about wanting execution over collaboration, the importance of reliability and seamlessness, and your vision for how AI could evolve to be more useful - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.\n\nI really appreciate how thoughtfully you approached these questions, from the practical day-to-day challenges right up to the broader implications of technological dependence.

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. \n\nWe're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.\n\nDuring our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.\n\nI'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\nUser: Soinds good. Let's proceed.\n\nAI: Great! Let's dive in.\n\nCould you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: I'm in real estate so I use Ai for a variety of tasks periodically throughout the day. Social Media ideas, data look up, creative writing for property descriptions, etc.\n\nAI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI touches several different aspects of your real estate work. \n\nCan you walk me through what a specific instance of using AI looks like for you? For example, when you're working on property descriptions, how does that process typically unfold?\n\nUser: For property descriptions I will typically enter a basic outline of facts about the property I want to highlight and then ask AI to create a decription that is less than 2000 characters and is mindfull of fair housing guidelines.\n\nAI: That's a really practical approach. You mentioned being mindful of fair housing guidelines - that sounds like an important consideration in real estate.\n\nTell me more about how you decide which facts about a property to include in that initial outline you give to AI. What goes through your mind when you're putting that together?\n\nUser: I definitely include the basics of room count, levels, locations, lot size, property use etc. It's important to have the correct information to market the property. i understand that AI doesn't have that info so I provide it and then lean on Ai to write an appealing description.\n\nAI: That makes a lot of sense - you're providing the factual foundation and letting AI handle the creative presentation.\n\nI'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your real estate work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?\n\nUser: Definitely, I've chosen not to utilize any Ai assistance with follow up and client communications. I am not quite trusting enough in Ai yet to allow any communications to leave my desk in my name that are not first reveiwed and approved by me directly. I know many agents are using automated Ai systems for this and I'm just not there yet.\n\nAI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. It sounds like there's something specific about client communications that feels different from other tasks like property descriptions.\n\nWhat is it about those client interactions that makes you want to keep that direct control? What would need to change for you to feel more comfortable with AI assistance in that area?\n\nUser: I think I would need to feel confident that the answers/responses or prompts would always sound human-like and friendly. In real estate, our clients do hire us as individuals rather than as a company or entity, and I always want my clients to feel heard and well cared for during their process\n\nAI: That really highlights the personal nature of your business - clients are hiring *you* specifically, not just any agent.\n\nWhen you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For something like those property descriptions, are you more likely to go back and forth with AI to refine it, or do you tend to give it your outline and let it handle the task from there?\n\nUser: I typically request at least 2 or 3 revisions but they are generally minor if I take the time to enter the prompt in a thoughtful manor.\n\nAI: It sounds like you've developed a pretty efficient process - putting care into that initial prompt to minimize the back-and-forth.\n\nHow have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other agents in your area using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?\n\nUser: I live in a rather rural area and I think many agents here have been hesitant to adopt AI into their bussiness. The larger metros are ahead of us there for sure. But yes, I do know some who are using AI quite well in their businesses.\n\nAI: That's an interesting dynamic - being in a more rural area where adoption might be slower.\n\nCan you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: Sure, I recently had a listing where many repairs were needed, and I wanted to convey that without using alarming language, and the AI model had a hard time with that. It tended to want to either make the property sound like a complete fixer-upper or a turnkey dream house. After several back and forths, I just ended up writing that one myself. In that particular situation, I think knowing the target audience and messaging, along with having seen the property in person, was key to an accurate yet effective marketing campaign.\n\nAI: That's a really revealing example - it sounds like there was something about that nuanced balance you needed that required your direct experience and judgment.\n\nHow do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: I do believe that the bulk of real estate will always require a human touch; it's a very emotional process for many. I'm trying to balance between letting AI do some of the behind-the-scenes tasks like marketing while I further develop my relationship skills.\n\nAI: That's a strategic way to think about it - using AI to handle background tasks so you can focus more on the human elements.\n\nLooking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think you might be with AI integration in, say, a year or two?\n\nUser: I really hope to find more AI solutions to automate more of my social media presence. The tricky part is having the public and my clients not notice that it's AI. I have a quirky writing style and sense of humor, and I've struggled to get AI to write in a way for social media that could pass as my own content.\n\nAI: That's fascinating - you want the efficiency benefits but need to maintain your authentic voice, especially when your personality is part of what clients connect with.\n\nThose are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that balance between efficiency and maintaining the personal touch that's so crucial in real estate relationships.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: I think we covered the key points Thank you!\n\nAI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating that balance between AI efficiency and maintaining authentic client relationships - especially in a field as personal as real estate - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your specific use cases and challenges. Have a great rest of your day!\n\nUser: Same to you!\n\nAI: Thank you! That was a really insightful interview. I appreciated how you opened up about your specific experiences and the thoughtful distinctions you make about when and how to use AI in your real estate work. Your perspective on maintaining authenticity while leveraging efficiency was particularly valuable.\n\nIf you have any questions about the research or would like to know more about our work at Anthropic, feel free to ask.

Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\nUser: Sounds good to me, let's begin.\n\nAI: Great! Let's dive right in.\n\nCould you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: I'm a data analyst at SUEZ and I use AI for a variety of things daily. Most common is when I'm coding for Excel , VBA , Power Query M or Dax. It saves a lot of time because it speeds up repetitive / tedious coding a ton. But I use it for other tasks as well. I have to prepare slide decks for meetings often and the narrative /tone that needs to be set can vary. AI can help create concise yet effective text for these slide decks. I also use AI for typing emails for the same reason, it's useful for going for a specific tone whilst still being concise\n\nAI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI is touching several different aspects of your work. You mentioned using it for coding, slide decks, and emails, all with this focus on efficiency and tone.\n\nWhen you're working on those coding tasks - the Excel, VBA, Power Query M, or DAX - can you walk me through what that interaction typically looks like? Are you asking AI to write entire functions, or is it more of a back-and-forth process?\n\nUser: Yes , I often tell it to write the entire code for a certain task. Other times, I'll provide it with some code I already have and then ask AI to modify it to do something additional or just to optimise it. Often for more complex tasks, AI will struggle to code it so I will manually walk through it step by step with the AI, providing clarifications along the way\n\nAI: That's interesting - so you've developed different approaches depending on the complexity. For those more complex tasks where you have to walk through it step by step with AI, providing clarifications along the way, what does that process feel like for you? \n\nIs that collaborative back-and-forth something you find valuable, or would you prefer if AI could just handle those complex tasks independently from the start?\n\nUser: I'd prefer if AI could handle it independently from the start. After all, the goal is efficiency and speed.  However collaborating usually isn't a bad experience, I do find it impressive and amusing how AI takes my corrections into account and seems to \"learn\" as we go along.\n\nAI: That's a great observation about AI seeming to \"learn\" during your interactions. You mentioned that your main goal is efficiency and speed - I'm curious about the other side of that coin.\n\nAre there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?\n\nUser: Yes , for super sensitive information, like budgets and other financial areas, I do them without AI. Any sort of mistake cannot be afforded for work in the Finance department, and AI is quite prone to errors, especially when it comes to Maths. I also don't use AI for any work where confidential information is involved. Technically, AI says it doesn't save the data you give it other than in your cookies, but I don't believe that.\n\nAI: That makes complete sense - the stakes are clearly different when you're dealing with financial data and confidential information. You mentioned AI being prone to errors, especially with math, which is particularly problematic in finance work.\n\nHow have your colleagues or your workplace culture at SUEZ influenced the way you use AI? Do you find that others share similar boundaries, or are there different approaches across your team?\n\nUser: I am the only person who really uses AI. I work as the sole data analyst on the team. It's generally a very hands-on office. There is of course a ton of computer usage, but it's all just using Excel documents and a few websites.\n\nAI: Interesting - so you're essentially pioneering AI use in your workplace. Being the only one using these tools in what sounds like a more traditional, hands-on environment must create a unique dynamic.\n\nCan you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: It makes me feel satisified on a daily basis. It helps me create things or discover features I would not have known otherwise. Like when it taught me about the Filter function in Excel, which allowed me to create an automated stock management system .\n\nAI: That's a perfect example - discovering the Filter function and using it to build an automated stock management system sounds like a significant breakthrough. It sounds like AI isn't just helping you work faster, but actually expanding your capabilities and knowledge.\n\nYou mentioned this happens on a daily basis. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: I don't believe AI could take over anytime soon. It requires a ton of hand holding, often even for relatively simple tasks. We're already at Chat GPT 5, and it's still this dependent on user help.\n\nAI: That's a really grounded perspective - you're seeing firsthand just how much guidance AI still needs, even with the latest versions. \n\nLooking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops, or do you think your current approach will largely stay the same?\n\nUser: I think I will continue to use it as I do. As a learning tool and an optimisation tool to save time\n\nAI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the sole AI user in a hands-on workplace, and how you've developed clear boundaries around sensitive financial data while still finding daily value in AI as a learning and optimization tool.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: No, I believe that covers the breadth of my AI usage at work.\n\nAI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a data analyst - from the practical coding applications to the trust considerations with financial data, and especially your perspective on AI's current limitations despite being an early adopter in your workplace - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your daily experiences with such detail.

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. \n\nWe're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.\n\nDuring our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.\n\nI'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. \n\nDoes that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\nUser: sounds great, let's go.\n\nAI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.\n\nCould you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: As a Complex Care Case Manager, I use AI multiple times throughout my workday. I'm responsible for in excess of 30 support workers, and so AI helps me to automate a lot of my HR admin workload. For example, I use AI to help me write my appraisal and clinical supervision reports. I also use AI a lot for writing emails, as this saves me a lot of time throughout the working day.\n\nAI: That sounds like AI is handling quite a bit of your administrative workload. When you're using AI for something like writing appraisal reports or emails, how do you typically work with it? Do you give it specific information and let it draft everything, or do you work back and forth with it more collaboratively?\n\nUser: I initially give the AI an overview of what I want to achieve. So, for example: \"write an email to my care workers which informs them that the cut-off for this month's payroll is [REDACTED]. Advise them that if their hours aren't logged on the XYZ platform by 23:59, they won't be processed in time, and will be paid in [REDACTED] instead. Advise them to contact Jane Doe in Payroll for any pay related queries\". Then, I'll wait for the response and check it over. If I want amendments, such as to the tone or to remove certain aspects of the response, I'll collaborate with the AI until I get my desired output.\n\nAI: That's a really clear process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?\n\nUser: Working in healthcare, I'm very conscious of service user confidentiality. therefore, I don't use AI to write any care plans - this feels too invasive.\n\nAI: That makes complete sense given the sensitive nature of that information. Beyond the confidentiality concerns with care plans, are there other tasks where you choose to handle things yourself even when AI might be able to help? What drives those decisions for you?\n\nUser: When looking at my staff's training data, I prefer to do this myself rather than using AI. This is because I don't have 100% faith that the AI will provide the right insights and conclusions based on the training data. This is imperative, as non-compliance with training in the healthcare industry is non-negotiable - this could lead to regulatory issues, and could result in my company having its CQC registration revoked. Therefore, I prefer to analyse training data myself.\n\nAI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed clear boundaries around where AI fits based on both confidentiality and the level of risk involved. \n\nHow have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your organization using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?\n\nUser: It's a bit of a mixed bag. What i've noticed is that the younger members of the team are more willing and engaged with adopting AI usage within their workdays. In comparison, the older members of the team are more reluctant and have reservations and concerns about adopting AI technology - the big concern seems to be that they're worried \"AI will take their jobs\". At a company level, our directors are very keen for us to adopt AI in our working days, to the point they're developing their own LLM.\n\nAI: That's fascinating that leadership is investing in developing their own LLM while you're seeing such different adoption patterns across age groups. \n\nCan you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: I felt really satisfied about my AI usage when I was tasked with writing a bid for a palliative care package. The caveat was that this package needed to be implementable quickly, due to the health status of the service user. Bid writing usually takes several hours, but using AI meant I could submit the bid much quicker than usual, and my company went on to be awarded the package. I was very careful about service user confidentiality - i.e. I didn't use the service user's name, just initials.\n\nAI: That's a powerful example of AI helping you respond quickly in a time-sensitive situation while still maintaining your ethical boundaries around confidentiality. \n\nHow do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: AI can never replace the human interaction required by my role. Part of my role entails visiting service users in person, to conduct both care plan reviews and spot checks of staff performance and compliance. Whilst AI may eventually take over a lot of my admin tasks, e.g. staff appraisals, I'm not at all concerned about my role as a whole, as it simply cannot be adopted by AI.\n\nAI: That's a really grounded perspective on how AI complements rather than replaces the core human elements of your work. \n\nLooking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?\n\nUser: Honestly, at this time I can't see my AI usage changing much over the next year or so. More long term, I'd really like to see an AI-powered care planning system - care plan writing is very time consuming, so a dedicated platform which can handle the admin side of this, whilst guaranteeing service user privacy and confidentiality, would be a game changer.\n\nAI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed clear boundaries based on confidentiality requirements and risk levels - that distinction between administrative tasks and direct care responsibilities really stood out.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: I have nothing further to add at this time - thank you.\n\nAI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI adoption in healthcare - especially how you balance efficiency gains with confidentiality requirements and risk management - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!"

I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.\n\nWe're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.\n\nOur conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\nUser: No questions, let's begin!\n\nAI: Great! Let's dive in. \n\nCould you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?\n\nUser: I'm a writer and editor, so my flow varies a lot from project to project, but generally it goes like this:\n-I go over the initial version of the project, be it notes I took on a show or movie or a rough draft someone else sends me, like a blog post or a manuscript. I take it in and make any obvious edits, like fixing typos or grammar mistakes, or rephrasing things that don't quite sound right.\n-I typically like to wait a while before proceeding with the next step, which is thinking over the whole project and how the major ideas fit together. This often involves me rearranging whole paragraphs, cutting and moving chunks of text, more intricate rephrasing, and sometimes adding headers to break up lengthy web posts. If I'm drafting an original post, it usually looks like me organizing thoughts into distinct categories and then weaving them together so they sound like they flow together naturally. If there are a lot of notes and the thoughts are hard to keep track of, I may color-code them to make it easier. If I'm doing something like editing a manuscript, this is where I might make more overarching story or character notes in the margins as I read.\n-The final step is to read the whole thing through again and polish it up, making sure that all my edits flow naturally and make sense, and, if it's not my work, that it still sounds like the original author. If I'm editing a manuscript, this is where I'll type out a letter highlighting what I think are the most crucial areas that need looking at. \n-If I'm editing or writing something for the web, the last step is to go through and do basic SEO edits.\n\nAI: That's a really thorough breakdown of your process - I can see how much thought goes into each stage. The way you describe waiting between that initial review and the deeper structural work is particularly interesting.\n\nWalk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?\n\nUser: Rarely, if ever, do I use AI in the creative process itself - I enjoy writing and I generating the basics takes the fun out of it for me. What I do use it for is to keep track of character and setting notes in original fiction and when reading complex manuscripts: My notes are often messy and disorganized, and when I was younger I often found myself wishing I could have some sort of Clippy-esque assistant that would just be able to read through my notes and answer any question I had directly. This is especially useful in works with a lot of characters or places to keep track of - doubly so for fictional ones with no other reference material for those things.\n\nAI: That's fascinating - you've essentially found your \"Clippy-esque assistant\" for organization! I love how specific that use case is. It sounds like you're using AI as a kind of smart filing system for complex information rather than for the creative generation itself.\n\nCan you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?\n\nUser: I was writing a scene in a fantasy setting that contained dozens of potential character interactions - I'm co-writing a novel with another author in a sort of literary roleplay-type format, so there are a number of potential interactions that could happen at any given time. I was able to use an AI assistant to go through the names and place them in different areas of a large palace ballroom and social scene, and then to move them around naturally as the scene continued. There is no way I could have pulled off the true randomness of the interactions and character groupings without such a tool, and the resulting scenes would not have been nearly as interesting as what we produced.\n\nAI: That's really compelling - using AI to manage the logistics of complex social dynamics so you could focus on the actual storytelling. It sounds like it enabled a level of scene complexity that would have been overwhelming to track manually.\n\nWhen you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?\n\nUser: I would say that it's maybe a 60-30-10 split - I wrote most of the background material, but my creative partner is in full control of the lead character, and therefore of wherever the scene goes. The AI's creative input is in choosing who is in what room at which time (aside from a few key characters who need to be in certain places at certain times for story reasons.) \n\nIt does also have a sort of tangential, accidental input, in that sometimes unless I refresh it by pasting the character list in again, the AI will begin to hallucinate characters who don't exist. Some of these characters and names, however, have been interesting enough that I did build them out and add them to the roster for later. None have been used yet, but there's at least one that I'm planning to use in the future.\n\nAI: That's such an interesting dynamic - the AI essentially acting as a logistics coordinator, but then its \"mistakes\" becoming creative sparks. I love that you've embraced those hallucinated characters as potential story elements rather than just seeing them as errors.\n\nWhat aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI this way?\n\nUser: I find it much easier to get over my procrastination instincts and start the scene, actually - I have ADHD and I'm awful at logistics, on my worst days it makes my head actually hurt a little bit. Having an easy workaround for that is really helpful, especially on days when I can't take my medication.\n\nIt also, as I mentioned before, has made for much more interesting character pairings than I would have thought to make on my own - I like that it forces me to consider less-than-obvious dynamics, like how the King might converse with his son's friends in a casual, convival setting.\n\nAI: That's really insightful - the way AI helps with both the executive function challenges and pushes you toward unexpected creative choices. The ADHD perspective is particularly valuable here - it sounds like AI is removing a barrier that was sometimes preventing you from getting to the creative work you actually enjoy.\n\nWhat concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?\n\nUser: I'm worried about the kids, honestly. I know how tempting it can be to use something like this as a crutch for the hard or boring stuff - if I had had the option of being able to put my thesis statement for an essay or something into an AI, and getting an already-finished outline back, I would have taken it every single time. But I would have been losing really valuable time exercising that mental muscle when I was young and still had the neuroplasticity for it to Really Take, and I have no doubt that I wouldn't be nearly as good a writer as I am today. And I probably would have wanted to roll my eyes at anyone trying to give me this warning, too. \n\nI'm also concerned at the sheer amount of what I'm going to call \"AI Slop\" (quickly, shoddily-made fiction generated entirely by an AI that was given no instructions about theme, message, or any other relevant content other than plot details, and therefore delivers very little human value relative to the time and effort it takes to read it) that seems to be widely available to read now. I know this makes me sound like a snob, but I truly feel like I never used to have to shuffle through so much empty-feeling fiction before I got to something good before. I see a lot of listings for it as an editor, and it's disheartening, because I really can tell the difference, and it loses something I can't put my finger on. It's like the uncanny valley for writing.\n\nAI: Those are really thoughtful concerns. The neuroplasticity point about developing those mental muscles early is particularly striking - that there might be critical periods for learning to think through complex problems that could be bypassed too easily.\n\nAnd your \"uncanny valley for writing\" observation is fascinating. You mentioned you can tell the difference - what do you think it is that you're sensing is missing in that AI-generated content, even if you can't quite put your finger on it?\n\nUser: I have almost no idea. I was like this with grammar when I was a kid, too - I could tell you immediately when something was wrong, but I usually had to look up the rule in order to be able to explain why. It was like it just hit my ear wrong or something. (It's why I became an editor.) It's the same thing with AI - I don't know if it's word choice or cadence or what, but I often just get that feeling, like something's just Off. A little too formulaic, maybe? Or too polished? Reads too much like textbook examples and the Better Answer Formula from like sixth grade? It varies, so it's hard to put a finger on exactly what it is, but those are my best guesses.\n\nAI: That's such a valuable insight - that intuitive ear you have for language picking up on something subtly \"off\" about the rhythm or authenticity, even when the technical execution might be correct. It sounds like your experience as an editor has given you a really fine-tuned sense for authentic voice versus something more manufactured.\n\nLooking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?\n\nUser: Well, first of all, I would definitely use it more if I could be assured the models I was using weren't guzzling gallons and gallons of water every time I ask a question. I do feel the guilt behind that weighing on me, which is one of the non-mental-exercise reasons I try to use it sparingly. \n\nThat said, if and when that becomes a non-factor, I can see myself naming various assistant bots for different projects I work on - like Jarvis or Friday from the Iron Man movies, but specifically for individual universes I am working on or with. It'd be really cool if I could develop a kind of template for that, and then use it to help other writers, like a service or something.\n\nI can also see myself using it for brainstorming and character dialogue-type stuff: I'm great at writing dialogue but not always great at coming up with the pretext to cover the subtext of important conversations. I feel like feeding character profiles into the right AI and asking it to just generate conversations and situations between them could spark some ideas for those types of things. \n\nI also see myself continuing to use it in another capacity I have not mentioned because it is not strictly creative: administrative tasks. Specifically: Emails, form letters, invoices, reminders, etc. I'm terrible at sounding professional in the traditional sense - I write exactly the way I talk, which is like a [REDACTED] who grew up on sitcoms and fan forums. I put what I want to say in normal person language, and the AI gives me back the professional email with all of the right terms (that I could not have remembered to use if you paid me) in all the right places. Expanding on that area of assistance - though I can't exactly imagine how - would be amazing for me.\n\nAI: Those are really compelling future applications - the idea of project-specific AI assistants for different fictional universes is particularly creative. And it's interesting how you're thinking about potentially turning that into a service for other writers.\n\nYou've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with the logistics that can be barriers to creativity, while also your concerns about preserving those crucial developmental opportunities for young writers.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: That covers everything!\n\nAI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing such detailed and thoughtful insights about your creative process and how AI fits into it. Your perspective on using AI as a logistics coordinator rather than a creative generator, your concerns about skill development in young writers, and that fascinating observation about the \"uncanny valley for writing\" have all been incredibly valuable.\n\nI found your approach particularly interesting - how you've found ways to preserve what you love about the creative process while using AI to remove barriers like complex organizational tasks that can trigger procrastination. And your vision for project-specific AI assistants is really innovative.\n\nThank you again for your time and for being so open about your experiences. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts."

Let's dive in then.\n\nCould you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: I'm a software developer at a science research lab...I've used AI to help me look up ways to code things or to explain how some code works. Software development is handled very differently where I work and we often work in silos based on the scientific group we are supporting, so I don't have a ton of co-workers to discuss things like this with and AI has been very helpful.\n\nAI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is filling a gap where you might not have as much peer collaboration available. \n\nCan you walk me through what that actually looks like when you're working? Like, when you hit a coding challenge or need to understand something, what does your process of turning to AI typically involve?\n\nUser: For instance, right now I'm preparing to develop a web application that will plot data from experiments. I've described what sort of plotting I'm looking for and asked Chat GPT about different Javascript plotting utilities that might be useful, and then I've asked for code to use those libraries.\n\nAI: So you're using it both for discovery - finding the right tools - and then for implementation help with those tools. \n\nWhen you get that code back from ChatGPT, what do you typically do with it? Do you use it as-is, or does it become more of a starting point for your own work?\n\nUser: Definitely more of a starting point\n\nAI: Tell me more about that process - what happens after you get that initial code? How do you work from there?\n\nUser: So for this plotting example, I asked the AI to generate essentially a library of plotting functions that I could then incorporate into a web page. It took some tweaking and back and forth with the AI  to be able to get it where I wanted it. Now I'm working on the web page/HTML part of it and will start incorporating that Javascript library.\n\nAI: That back-and-forth tweaking process sounds interesting. When you're going through those iterations with the AI, are you working together on refining the same piece of code, or are you taking what it gives you, trying it out on your own, and then coming back with specific issues?\n\nUser: Typically the second scenario - taking what it gives me, trying it, and then going back and describing any problems or issues that I want changed\n\nAI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your development work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?\n\nUser: Some things I like to think about on my own or trying to describe what I'm looking for would be harder and more time-consuming than just doing it myself.\n\nAI: Can you give me an example of something that falls into that category - where describing it to AI would be more work than just doing it yourself?\n\nUser: Like if I have other code that's already been written and I don't necessarily want to bring all of that into what I'm asking for because I just want help with something specific.\n\nAI: That makes sense - there's that context barrier where you'd need to explain too much background. \n\nWhen you do use AI for work tasks, it sounds like you've settled into a pattern where you delegate a specific piece to it, then iterate based on what comes back. Do you ever find yourself working more collaboratively with AI - like thinking through a problem together step by step - or is it mostly that delegation approach?\n\nUser: Mostly that delegation approach.\n\nAI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that you work more in silos - has that shaped how you think about using these tools?\n\nUser: I don't think it's necessarily shaped anything with how I use these tools, but we have discussed the use of AI in our work so it's definitely become more of a relevant tool for us\n\nAI: What kinds of discussions have you had about AI use? Are people generally sharing how they're using it, or is it more about policies around using it?\n\nUser: A little of both, I guess. Other folks have used it for basic coding. We've also generally talked about potentially developing a chatbot or something as a tool for the scientists to use but we haven't really started seriously working on anything like that.\n\nAI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: The going back and forth can be very rewarding and very frustrating. For example with this plotting library...it took a lot of clarification about certain details, like how the x and y axes would work or how the mouse clicks would work. Also debugging certain things. It's harder to debug because I didn't write the original code so I either have to go back and understand what the model was trying to do or I have to do a lot of back and forth describing exactly what's happening that's wrong and then exactly what it should be doing instead.\n\nAI: That debugging challenge sounds particularly tricky - you're dealing with code that's written in someone else's style, essentially. When you're in those frustrating back-and-forth cycles, what keeps you using AI rather than just rewriting the code yourself from scratch?\n\nUser: I've gotten close to the point of abandoning ship and writing it myself, but haven't needed to yet. I think if it ever got to where the AI was just absolutely not giving me what I wanted and I wasn't able to describe something any better than I was, that would be the point that I would just write it myself.\n\nAI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: Right now incorporating AI into what I'm doing feels useful...I think AI will eventually be able to do a lot of the code development, but knowing what to ask for and describe it is a useful skill for now. I haven't really thought about it much more than that.\n\nAI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?\n\nUser: I'm not sure, but I imagine using it more and more...perhaps in the collaborative way that you brought up earlier\n\nAI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the debugging process can be both rewarding and frustrating when you're working with code you didn't originally write.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: Not that I can think of\n\nAI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working in a more isolated environment, the iterative process of refining AI-generated code, and that balance between when to persist with AI versus doing it yourself will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today!"

What specifically are you changing when you use AI to help format those emails?\n\nUser: In general, my emails are written in the style that I speak, but AI can 'polish' my response by using words or phrases that mean the same thing but sound less colloquial - if I have a lot of time, I could phrase the email better myself but often I need to send the response quickly so I can get on with other things and AI thinks much more quickly than I do!\n\nAI: That makes a lot of sense - so it's really about efficiency and speed when you're juggling multiple tasks. \n\nWhen you say AI \"thinks much more quickly\" than you do for this particular task, what does that process actually look like? Do you write out your full response first and then ask AI to polish it, or do you work with it differently?\n\nUser: No, I do exactly that - write a quick response as it comes to me, and then ask AI to re-word it to sound more professional.\n\nAI: Got it - so you draft it in your natural voice first, then hand it over for that professional polish.\n\nI'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?\n\nUser: We will often provide an invoice for the customer once they've had work done, which perhaps could be done by AI. The invoice will contain information on the name of the service and what that entailed, so AI could do this part - but I worry that it might get some details wrong, meaning I have to check it anyway and so it wouldn't save me any time in the long run.\n\nAI: That's a really insightful distinction - the trust factor and the need to verify accuracy. It sounds like with email formatting, you can easily spot if something's off, but with invoices, the stakes feel different.\n\nTell me more about that worry of getting details wrong. What kinds of details are you most concerned AI might miss or misinterpret when it comes to invoicing?\n\nUser: On the occasions where the customer requires the invoice to be 100% accurate because they are claiming money back from a warranty company, I would worry that AI might miss something or make a mistake, meaning that the customers claim is delayed - this would probably cause the customer to complain to us, and we want to avoid this kind of situation as it could lead to us losing customers. For example, if a customer had a suspension component replaced, AI may not include the full details about the part or any supplementary work that was also needed, meaning that the customer does not get the full cost refunded.\n\nAI: That really highlights the high stakes involved - where a small error could cascade into customer complaints and potentially lost business. It sounds like those invoice details require very specific domain knowledge about parts and supplementary work that you'd be concerned AI might not capture accurately.\n\nWhen you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?\n\nUser: Yes, although I do love how AI can give me an almost instant response, I always want to check it for accuracy meaning it does not save me the amount of time I need it to - so yes, when I use it, it's in collaboration with me also carrying out elements to make sure that everything is 100% accurate.\n\nAI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense given your concerns about accuracy. It sounds like you've found this sweet spot with email polishing where the collaboration works well, but for other tasks the verification step might actually slow things down rather than speed them up.\n\nHow have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?\n\nUser: AI is not widely used in our workplace as the majority of the work carried out is manual, and to integrate AI would mean large financial investment which the business cannot/doesn't want to pay out currently. As I carry out admin tasks there is more scope for me to use AI, but my other admin colleagues are more reluctant as they've had less exposure and so are more unsure of the capabilities.\n\nAI: That paints a really clear picture - you're almost a pioneer in AI use within your workplace because of both the nature of your role and your comfort level with the technology.\n\nWhen you say your admin colleagues are \"more unsure of the capabilities,\" what do you think they're most uncertain about? Is it more about not knowing what AI can do, or concerns about what might go wrong?\n\nUser: I think it's a combination of the two elements - their exposure so far has been limited to people telling them about how AI helped them re-design their garden, or helped their child with a school project, so they find it hard to see how it can translate to help us with what we do. Then there is the worry that AI cannot know everything that we know and so they will have to get involved anyway.\n\nAI: That's fascinating - so there's this gap between the consumer uses they've heard about and seeing the professional applications, plus that same concern you mentioned about still needing to verify everything anyway.\n\nCan you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: Recently, I tried using AI to generate an invoice for a customer. The next day, they emailed to say that the type of service they had asked for was different to what they had received, according to the invoice. This was frustrating, because the customer had received what they had asked for, but the AI invoice had just used the standard information, whereas if I had generated it myself, I would have tailored it to the customers expectations, avoiding any complaints.\n\nAI: That's a perfect example of what you were describing earlier - where AI missed those nuanced details that you would have naturally included. It sounds like you understand not just the technical aspects of what was done, but also how to frame it in a way that matches the customer's mental model of what they requested.\n\nHow do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?\n\nUser: I do worry sometimes that roles like mine could be made obsolete by AI, but I also think that it will be many years before that happens, due to situations like the one above. I have considered growing my skillset to include more technological capabilities, but haven't decided on which route to take yet.\n\nAI: That balance between recognizing the potential threat but also seeing the current limitations is really thoughtful. It sounds like you're in this interesting position where you can see both AI's capabilities and its current gaps pretty clearly.\n\nLooking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?\n\nUser: I think I will continue to use it for the tasks we know it can do well (such as emails to customers) and I will probably use it more frequently for this than I do now. But I also think that some elements such as invoicing will remain a person specific activity to ensure accuracy.\n\nAI: That makes perfect sense - leaning more into what's already working well while maintaining human oversight where accuracy is critical.\n\nThose are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how trust and verification needs vary so much depending on the task and the stakes involved.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?\n\nUser: No, I think I've shared everything relevant.\n\nAI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced differences between tasks - where AI works well versus where human expertise is still essential - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.\n\nIt's been really valuable to hear your perspective, especially as someone navigating AI adoption in a workplace where you're somewhat of a pioneer. Thanks again!"

                  "Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. \n\nWe're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.\n\nDuring our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.\n\nI'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. \n\nDoes that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\nUser: Sounds good, let's begin\n\nAI: Great! Let's dive in.\n\nCould you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?\n\nUser: AI for me mostly acts as the librarian of the internet. I use it primarily to gather information about topics / resources, or to act as a tutor to teach me new concepts. Occasionally I'll get it to write code for me as well\n\nAI: That's a really interesting way to think about it - AI as the librarian of the internet. I like that framing.\n\nWhen you say you use it to gather information about topics and resources, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? What's a recent example of when you've done this?\n\nUser: I work in IT Support, so quite often I'll embark on a new journey and want to find the \"go to\" solution for something. As an example, I recently wanted to set up a cloud hosted server for a cheap price, just to set up some automation for myself. I used AI to give me an overview of what options are available, what is most commonly used, and what the public consensus is for each of these options.\n\nAI: That's a really practical use case. So you're using AI to get that landscape view of your options before diving deeper.\n\nTell me more about that cloud server research - once AI gave you that overview of the options and public consensus, what did you do next? Did you continue working with AI throughout that process, or did you take that information and go handle the rest yourself?\n\nUser: I take care of most of the rest of the process myself - Once I'm given a direction by the AI and no longer need to navigate the 'noise' of the internet, I don't need much more guidance. In this case, I asked it some specific questions when I ran into roadblocks with setting up an EC2 instance, but I find AI struggles with navigating platform specific workflows like AWS EC2 (which, to be fair, is always changing and kind of poorly documented)\n\nAI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to cut through the noise and get oriented, then taking the reins yourself once you have direction.\n\nYou mentioned that AI struggles with those platform-specific workflows that are constantly changing. Are there other types of tasks where you've found AI less helpful, or where you deliberately choose to handle things yourself even though AI could potentially assist?\n\nUser: AI tends to be good at very high level, or very low level. Most easily explained with programming: If I provide it with a context for an application I want to build, it's very good at producing a high-level plan for the technology stack, classes, libraries, and general responsibilities. Similarly, if I ask it to implement a single function and give it the full context, it will probably do that well. \n\nit struggles in the middle, where I've got a half-built application; some of it works, some of it doesn't. Some of it needs to be re-factored, and progressing from this point is no longer linear. \nAI struggles with this kind of problem solving, and often causes more frustration than anything. I think this is a combination of lack of context, but also lack of ability for the AI to just say \"i don't know\" or ask questions to get more context.\n\nAI: That's a really insightful observation about AI working well at the extremes but struggling in that messy middle ground. The point about AI not saying \"I don't know\" or asking clarifying questions is particularly interesting.\n\nWhen you hit those situations where you have a half-built application that needs troubleshooting or refactoring, how do you typically approach that work? Do you find yourself missing having a collaborator who could ask those clarifying questions, or do you prefer working through those complex problems solo?\n\nUser: I mostly work through those problems solo. Again, I'll use AI only to answer very specific questions, or to do some research for me that might lead me to the answer im looking for.\n\nAI: That pattern is really clear - you seem to have developed a pretty specific way of working with AI where you maintain control of the overall problem-solving process.\n\nHow have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others in your IT support role approach AI differently, or is there any organizational guidance around how to use these tools?\n\nUser: Honestly, most people I've spoken with have very little understanding of LLMs under-the-hood, and give AI models too much precedence because they sound so *convincing*. \nIn my -limited- experience, I often find that colleagues try to get AI to do meaningful work for them (\"write this knowledge base article..\", \"write a full powershell script that does...\") which either produces slop, or again causes them frustration because it doesn't work first try.\n\nAI: That's a really telling observation about how AI's convincing tone can be misleading. It sounds like you've developed a more calibrated sense of what AI is actually good at versus what it sounds like it can do.\n\nCan you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?\n\nUser: There have been times where using Claude Code was genuinely satisfying. There are rare moments where it feels like I am speaking with a colleague and an equal, and we're both trying to solve a problem together through discussion and trial and error. This natural flow of discussion and the terminal interface - as opposed to the web chat room - makes the AI feel more natural, and fits into my existing workflow more easily.\n\nAI: That's fascinating - it sounds like Claude Code created a different kind of interaction experience for you. The fact that it felt like speaking with a colleague and equal is really striking.\n\nWhat specifically about that terminal interface and natural flow of discussion made it feel more collaborative compared to your typical AI interactions? What was different about those moments that made the partnership feel more genuine?\n\nUser: Largely the difference in context. With Claude Code, I can say \"investigate this function\" and it will gather its own context, because it has access to the files. \n\nOn the contrary, the web chat version requires that I provide all the context and ask *very* specific questions. \n\nThere's also a more personal note. Running a program in my own terminal makes it feel more like it is 'mine'. Web browsers have become just a place for advertisements, so i don't feel as kindly towards them.\n\nAI: That's really insightful - the ability for AI to gather its own context changes the whole dynamic of the interaction. And I appreciate that personal observation about the terminal feeling more \"yours\" compared to web browsers.\n\nHow do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it factor into how you decide what to delegate versus what to handle yourself?\n\nUser: I can't say I'm worried. I don't feel that AI - or specifically LLMs - will improve significantly from where they are now, and they're definitely not ready to take entire jobs like my own. \n\nIn the case that they *do* improve to be expert level and completely independent engineers, for example, I would just see this as an opportunity to build my own software / business completely solo. \n\nI'm fine with either direction\n\nAI: That's a really balanced perspective - not worried, but ready to adapt either way. It sounds like you see potential improvements in AI as opening up new opportunities rather than closing them off.\n\nLooking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue with this current approach of using it as your \"internet librarian,\" or do you see that changing as the tools develop?\n\nUser: As far as producing meaningful work, I only see value in programming, personally. \nOtherwise, AI will remain a librarian for me or a source of brainstorming / tutoring.\n\nAI: That's all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI working well at the extremes but struggling in that messy middle ground, and how the terminal interface in Claude Code created a more collaborative feeling.\n\nBefore we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?"
